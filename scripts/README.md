These are extension scripts that can be used with Wing Pro and Wing Personal.
See the documentation within each script for details.

The following additional extensions are hosted in other repositories:

https://github.com/grahamu/flake8panel -- Flakes8 tool for Wing 6
https://bitbucket.org/stj/pep8panel/wiki/Home -- PEP8 tool for Wing 5
https://bitbucket.org/stj/pyflakespanel/wiki/Home -- PyFlakes tool for Wing 5
https://github.com/luc-j-bourhis/WingIDE-setuptools -- Setuptools and distutils panel
https://github.com/cool-RR/cute-wing-stuff -- A collection of many useful scripts

To install a script, copy it to the scripts sub-folder of your User Settings 
Directory (see http://www.wingware.com/doc/install/user-settings-dir) and 
then select Reload All Scripts from the Edit menu in Wing.  If a script adds 
no menu items, you will need to create a key binding to it using the User 
Interface > Keyboard > Custom Key Bindings preference.

Details on writing your own extension scripts can be found at
