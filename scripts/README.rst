Installing Extension Scripts
............................

To install a script, copy it to the scripts sub-folder of your User Settings 
Directory (see http://www.wingware.com/doc/install/user-settings-dir) and 
then select Reload All Scripts from the Edit menu in Wing.  If a script adds 
no menu items, you will need to create a key binding to it using the User 
Interface > Keyboard > Custom Key Bindings preference.
